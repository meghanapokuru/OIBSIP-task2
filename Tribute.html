            <p class="paragraph">C.V. Raman, in full Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman, (born November 7, 1888,
                Trichinopoly, India—died November 21, 1970, Bangalore), Indian physicist whose work was influential in
                the growth of science in India. He was the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930 for the
                discovery that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the light that is deflected changes
                in wavelength. This phenomenon is now called Raman scattering and is the result of the Raman effect.

                <li class="paragraph1">After earning a master’s degree in physics at Presidency College, University of Madras, in 1907,
                    Raman became an accountant in the finance department of the Indian government. He became professor
                    of physics at the University of Calcutta in 1917.
                </li>
                <li class="paragraph1">
                    Studying the scattering of light in various substances, in 1928 he found that when a transparent
                    substance is illuminated by a beam of light of one frequency, a small portion of the light emerges
                    at right angles to the original direction, and some of this light is of different frequencies than
                    that of the incident light.
                </li>
                <li class="paragraph1">
                    These so-called Raman frequencies are the energies associated with transitions between different
                    rotational and vibrational states in the scattering material.
                </li>
                <li class="paragraph1">
                    In 1947 he was named director of the Raman Research Institute there and in 1961 became a member of
                    the Pontifical Academy of Science.
                </li>
                <li class="paragraph1">
                    He won the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics, with William Fowler.
